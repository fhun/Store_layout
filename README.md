## Abstract

Layout strategy, one of the retail management approach, is a crucial technique to influence
customer behavior in the shopping process. And the flourish data storage capacity gives the
advantage to extract customers’ behavior patterns from transaction data to enhance the store layout.
This report proposes a retail layout strategy based on the association rules, one of data mining
based approaches, to find the best layout that minimizes wasted steps among product categories
in the store. And improve the initial store layout with a greedy search optimization method. The
evaluation performance of this approach appears to outperform the store layout of the random
assignment product category and improve with local search algorithm policy.
